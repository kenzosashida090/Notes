We can use modules when our program its getting  complex , export some data like a date, craeting another js which we store our module and with expor.module() we exports what ever we wants from this module like the date to use it in our main.js
We store our module in our main.js with a require const date = require(__dirname + "/date.js")

If we want to export more than one data we could create an object to export the function that we want for example:

				module exports.getDate = getDate;

				on our main.js

				const date = require(__dirname + "/date.js")

				let day =date.getDate();
