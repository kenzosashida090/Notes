With Selenium we can interact with a browser we can authomatize, like filling forms

to use selenium we set the next line of code:

frm selenium import webdriver

the chrome driver will allows use to interact with in this case chrome because its a chrome driver
bt this driver Selenium will know how to operate

To hold a web page we need to write : 

driver.get("https://www.amazon.com")

Due new updates from selenium we need to tab the next code text:

from selenium import  webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

find element by name its the most used in programming when it comes when we fill forms.

if we need to fined some elements that doesent have any classes or id like an anchor tag  we could use find element by css
which we put the father and child selector like 

("div class name a")

we will found that a by entering to the div class and then search for the ancher tag

find element by xpath is the most precise function to find a element onlyu we have to go to the element that we want to search
and then we insepct and we click right and we select xpath cpy
