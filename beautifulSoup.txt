beautiful soup pull out html elements that we are intrested in.
we initialize an object soup with the BeautifulSoup Class then in the argument it will be the html content the file that we open with open ("website.html") as file: and the html.parser as a second argument that we can read this html file. but the best way is to use a lxml  and we need to import lxml:
we can acces to for example title with soup.title. to get the string soup.title.string if we want search all certain tags like ancherags  soup.find_all("Tag that you want to search") and to hold the text well need a for loop to access all the tags and get the text tag.getText().

To get the attribute for example the link href only we need to tag.get("href") if we want to access by an id we put soup.find("h1",id = "name ) and if we want to look for a class insted of class we add an underline soup.find("h1",class_ = "name" )

To select a selector we need to soup.select_one(selector = "p a") the a tag that its inside a paragraph
